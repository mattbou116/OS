### Running Shell

1. Interactive mode : from the command line prompt "./mysh"
2. Batch mode : passing in scripts "./mysh < testfile.txt"

---

### Command Beh.

- case sensitive
- unsupported commands -> "Unknown command"
- __set VAR STRING__
    - look in the shell memory (dictionary) to see if VAR already exisits
        - if so, overwrites it
        - if not, add it
- __print VAR__
    - look in the shell memory (dictionary) to see if VAR already exisits
        - if so, print value
        - if not, print "Variable does not exist"
- __run SCRIPT.TXT__
    - assumes test file exists within the current directory     
        (maybe change to see if test file exists?)
        (maybe change to the given directory?)
        - opens test file and send lines one at a time to interpreter.
        - shell does not stop if invalid commands are given.

---

### Tools to be using
- gdb (incase I fuck shit up)
- valgrind (check memory usage)

---

### Cool things to implement
- dynamic memory allocation for shell instead of static.
    - probably not realistic, but ought to read more on OS.
    - by the time I get to the third assignment, see if it makes sense to make
        the memory a stack with an upper limit for the size 
        (then you can determine if the size is too big -- stack overflow)
        (probably just be easier/efficient to do static at this point but 
            should look into it)
